# Augmentations for BWAPI to help new users starting out

For part of research into ways to make a simplified way of making bots for RTS games, some additions for BWAPI were designed to help new users making their first bot. These are designed for users that are first starting out with BWAPI and might struggle with some of the more complex workings of developing in a non-deterministic environment. They aren't there to be used in every project, and some users may find them restrictive after a time, however they are designed for new users who might find starting out with BWAPI in its entirety overwhelming.


You can find the full documentation in the pdf in the root folder. The example bot and the empty bot for the user to work in are also both in the repositry.

Please could you download the project and try out the library classes of the 
  - Production Queue
  - Builder Manager
  - Squad Manager
  - Enemy Base Tracker

And from there could you please provide feedback on the facebook post about whether you think that these added classes would make it easier for somebody starting out with the system for the first time. 

Thank You
